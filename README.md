# vim backup
* To install a plugin cd to vimfiles/bundle then git clone the repo and add whatever they say to the _vimrc
  * cp vimfiles and _vimrc to home dir (windows: C:/Users/userName or ~/)
  * Note the github location in vimfiles/bundle and commit and push if it is fast and actually solves a problem or serves a need
